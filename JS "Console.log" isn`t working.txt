JS
Console.log isn`t working. 

I'm working on a site where some JS (or other) code is preventing console.log from working (console.log is probably overwritten). 
You can test this by checking if console.log works on a different page (like this one).

Type console.log in the console and check what function gets returned.
If you see ƒ log() { [native code] } then it's something else.
If you see ƒ (){} then somewhere down the line the native console.log function was changed.
Was working on a client's site today and that was the issue.
If that's the case, you can either manually restore the console.log function or use console.dir() or console.warn() instead.

RESTORE:

function restoreConsole() {
  // Create an iframe for start a new console session
  var iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
  // Hide iframe
  iframe.style.display = 'none';
  // Inject iframe on body document
  document.body.appendChild(iframe);
  // Reassign the global variable console with the new console session of the iframe
  console = iframe.contentWindow.console;
  window.console = console;
  // Don't remove the iframe or console session will be closed
}

restoreConsole();
